# pizza_sales_analysis_SQL

This project involves analyzing a dataset related to pizza sales, focusing on various aspects of the business such as order details, pizza types, and pricing. The data is organized into multiple tables, each representing different components of the sales process, including order details, pizza types, and individual pizzas with their respective sizes and prices.

The primary goal of this project is to load and organize the data into a PostgreSQL database and then perform SQL queries to derive insights. These insights include calculating the total number of orders, determining the total revenue generated, identifying the highest priced pizza, and analyzing ordering patterns such as the most common pizza size and the most popular pizza types.

By using SQL, we can efficiently query the database to answer key business questions, helping the pizza shop understand its sales trends and make informed decisions. This project demonstrates the use of SQL for data analysis, including creating tables, loading data from CSV files, and executing complex queries to extract meaningful information from the dataset.

The steps involved include:

Creating the necessary tables in the database.
Loading data into these tables from CSV files.
Executing SQL queries to analyze the data and generate reports.
This project provides a comprehensive overview of how data can be managed and analyzed using SQL in a PostgreSQL environment, offering valuable insights into the operations of a pizza shop.
